I've added a lot of small tweaks and changes to the theme to make it better on the eyes.

More changes to come + detailed list of changes(?)

# Changes

+ Post Entries have a 20px gap between eachother
+ Added customization options, ability to switch from gradient or solid colour theme (as well as change the colours freely),
+ Added a better Pagination, the default freya pagination is no good.
+ Added more Edge styles (Rounded 3px, 5px, 8px + Sharp Edges).
+ Added Weeaboo Mode boolean option, translates the theme to Japanese (might add Korean).
+ Default font size is now 11 (small mode is an option 8px).
+ Default width is 500 (small mode is an option, 400px).

More to come
