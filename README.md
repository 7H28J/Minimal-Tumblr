# Minimal Tumblr Theme

Modification of Freyja - theme 12
by Copenhagen themes // cphthms.tumblr.com

I've added a lot of small tweaks and changes to the theme to make it better on the eyes.

# Changes

+ Post Entries have a 20px gap between eachother
+ Added customization options, ability to switch from gradient or solid colour theme (as well as change the colours freely),
+ Added a better Pagination, the default freya pagination is no good.
+ Added more Edge styles (Rounded 3px, 5px, 8px + Sharp Edges).
+ Added Weeaboo Mode boolean option, translates the theme to Japanese (might add Korean).
+ Added Boolean to Like + Reblog buttons, customizable colours.
*    Inactive > #2d2d2d
*    Reblog Hover > #75b1d6
*    Like Hover > ff6767
+ Added Boolean for disabling right clicking
+ Default font size is now 11 (small mode is an option 8px).
+ Default width is 500 (small mode is an option, 400px).
+ Lightbox works for Single Posts along with Photosets now.
+ Added optional twitter feed, default is setup to mine.

+ Tidied up the code, made it easier to understand and change.

More to come
